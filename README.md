Integrated non-English sentiment lexicons

Three new sentiment lexicons were generated for each of the three languages (Arabic, French and Malay). These lexicons consisted of the seed words generated in the lexicon-based layer (L1) and the polarity words extracted from the unannotated corpus in the corpus-based layer (L2). Moreover, these polarity words were reviewed by human experts in the human-based layer. These new lexicons are referred to as integrated sentiment lexicons (ISL) in this study and tagged with language to differentiate them. In other words, the lexicon is referred to as Arabic integrated sentiment lexicon (AISL), French integrated sentiment lexicon (FISL) and Malay integrated sentiment lexicon (MISL).
